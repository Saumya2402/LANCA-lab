  details: |
    Our lab focuses on high-fidelity modeling of strong viscous-inviscid interactions (VII). 
    By utilizing advanced numerical schemes, we aim to capture shock-induced separation 
    and trailing edge stall phenomena with greater accuracy than traditional RANS methods.

  summary: "Data-driven turbulence models using neural networks."
  details: |
    We are applying deep learning techniques to improve the closure coefficients in 
    turbulence models (like Spalart-Allmaras and k-omega). Current work explores 
    physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).

  summary: "Impact of blunt trailing edges on efficiency and acoustics."
  details: |
    Small changes in trailing edge geometry can have significant impacts on drag 
    and acoustic signatures. This research quantifies these effects using both 
    experimental measurement and CFD.
